# Screen Flow & Transition Analysis

This document details the current visual architecture and transition mechanics of the UPAGRAHA '26 website. The site operates as a single-page application (SPA) where vertical scrolling primarily drives complex horizontal or transformational animations via GSAP.

## 1. Preloader
**Visuals**:
- A dark overlay covering the entire screen.
- Text: "LOADING UNIVERSE" with a glitch effect.
- A progress bar filling from 0% to 100%.

**Behavior**:
- **Auto-Progress**: The bar fills automatically (simulated loading) over a short period.
- **Exit**: Once 100% is reached, the loader fades out (`opacity: 0`), reveals the main content, and initializes the GSAP animations.

## 2. Global Background
**Visuals**:
- `div#universe-bg`: A static or CSS-animated dark universe background.
- `canvas#stars-canvas`: A dynamic starfield generated by JS (`starfield.js`), likely responding to mouse movement or scroll.

## 3. Hero Section (Home)
**State**: Initial View (Top of page)
**Visuals**:
- **Background**: `hero_main.png` (Loki/Time Variance Authority theme).
- **Foreground Elements**:
  - Top: Department label.
  - Center: Large "UPAGRAHA '26" title with "National Level Technical Symposium" tagline.
  - Bottom: Countdown timer to the event.
  - Actions: "Register" and "Events" buttons.
  - Clubs: Logos for IETE, RACE, ECEA.
- **Interactions**:
  - **Mouse Parallax**: Moving the mouse causes the background image and floating elements to shift slightly, creating depth.

**Transition: "The Hero Shrink"** (Scroll Down)
- **Trigger**: Scrolling down from the top.
- **Mechanism**: The `#hero-about-wrapper` is **pinned** (stays fixed in view).
- **Animation**:
  - The entire `#hero-container` (holding the bg image and all hero content) **shrinks** (`scale: 1` -> `0.5`).
  - It moves to the **bottom-right** corner of the screen.
  - `border-radius` increases to `20px`, turning the full-screen hero into a "card".
  - **Simultaneously**: The **About Section** slides in from the left to fill the empty space.

## 4. About Section
**State**: Visible after Hero shrink
**Visuals**:
- **Left Side**: "THE CORE MISSION" text content describing the department.
- **Right Side**:
  - **Stats Grid**: 4 cards showing Participants, Events, Projects, Success metrics.
    - *Animation*: Numbers count up from 0 to their target values as they appear.
  - **Hero Card**: The shrunk Hero section now acts as a visual element in this layout.

**Transition**:
- Scrolling further unpins the wrapper and allows the user to continue down to the Timeline.

---

## 5. Timeline Section ("Sacred Timeline")
**Visuals**:
- **Background**: `timeline.png` (TVA Monitor aesthetic).
- **Content**: A horizontal "Sacred Timeline" graphic with branching paths.
- **Events**: Nodes on the line representing dates (Oct 15, Nov 01, etc.) labeled Past, Present, Future.

**Behavior**:
- **Pinned Scroll**: The section pins to the screen.
- **Horizontal Scrub**: Vertical scrolling translates the content horizontally (`x: 0` -> `-scrollDistance`).
- **Animations**: Branch lines and event nodes fade/slide in as they enter the viewport.

---

## 6. Events Section ("Multiverse")
**Visuals**:
- **Background**: Full-screen Canvas (`#events-canvas`).
- **Overlay**: initial text "MULTIVERSE EVENTS".

**Behavior**:
- **Cinematic Scrub**:
  - The section pins.
  - Scrolling "scrubs" through a sequence of 83 WebP frames (`assets/frames/frame X.webp`), creating a video-like animation effect controlled by scroll speed.
- **End State**:
  - At frame ~72/78, the "Infinity Stones" container fades in.
  - **Infinity Stones**: 6 circular buttons arranged in a branching pattern (Space, Mind, Reality, Time, Power, Soul). Each links to a specific event universe page (e.g., `events/universe1.html`).

---

## 7. Sponsors Section
**Visuals**:
- Vertical scroll section.
- "Why Sponsor" grid with 4 feature cards (Participants, Brand Visibility, etc.).
- "View Sponsorship Tiers" button.
- "Partners" section (currently "Revealing Soon").

**Interactions**:
- Standard CSS hover effects on cards.

---

## 8. Team Section
**Visuals**:
- Header: "THE SQUAD".
- **Tabs**: Filter buttons for ECEA, IETE-SF, RACE.
- **Grid**: Dynamic grid of team member cards (populated by `team.js`).

**Interactions**:
- Clicking a tab filters the grid to show only members of that club.

---

## 9. Contact & Footer
**Visuals**:
- **Contact**: "ESTABLISH LINK" form (Name, Email, Message) with a "Transmit" button.
- **Footer**: Multi-column layout with Quick Links, Event list, and Contact info.

**Interactions**:
- Standard form submission and link navigation.
